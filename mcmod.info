      "description": "Extreme Survival made for Minecraft!  Created by: maikerumine for Minetest, then made for Minecraft!  This game / mod is a re-creation of Extreme Survival Minetest, and adds most of the Minetest specific blocks and items, as well as all the main es stuff to keep the environment as close to the original as possible.  The crafting has also been altered to match Minetest as close as possible.  When you start, you first find bones, use 9 bones to make dirt, then surround an apple with 8 dirt for sapling.  Good luck!  PROTIP:   Best used with BiomeTweaker and BiomeTweakerCore to get full effect of all stone world.  Place the BiomeTweaker folders into your config folder in your Forge installation.",
