Always carry a machine gun or strong sword.
Little spiders can crawl through walls, and they will kill you fast.
The green toxic liquids are dangerous.
Lava is hot.
Food is your friend.
Don't drown..  k.

If got lost, type /spawn to return to space.
You can trade with the villagers.
Some mobs cannot be killed with gun.
Optdi is a cursed village, don't ever go there.
You can right-click bad_player NPC (The nice ones) with gold lump to get nice food or tool.
The Dungeon_Master cannot shoot through protected walls.
The server crashes more when ADMIN is online.
Your bed is your set home feature...
The public mines are your BEST chance of getting great ores, at the cost of more dangerous mobs.
Jtee is a wonderful road / rail / tunnel builder.
Sorcerykid is the bestest Admin ever!!!
Asia14 used to chat alot on the original Just Test.
Lag, the original creator of just test is a great inspiration to us all.
gold_digger was very helpful to just test, despite seeming grouchy at times.
Fixer makes some pretty ultra realistic home builds.
AspireMint is very clever with elephants.
If you want a special message about you, just ask the ADMIN!
Type /verse for some Biblical wisdom.
If you want a free place to stay, look for the apartment towers and make a choice.

THE LANDSCAPE IS DANGEROUS:  THERE ARE RADIOACTIVE MINERALS, LAVA, MUD, TOXIC WATER, AND MOBS.
ROADS, BRIDGES, AND RAILWAY ARE GREAT WAYS TO GET AROUND FAST ON THE SERVER.  THE UNDERGROUND SUBWAYS CAN TAKE YOU QUITE FAR IF YOU HAVE A MINECART- LOOK FOR THEM AND GRAB OR BUY FROM SHOP.  
TO USE TELEPORTERS:  STAND IN FRONT OF SIGN WITH THE DESIRED DEPTH.  PUNCH THE TOP BOX TO GET YOU THERE.  TYPE /spawn to get back to space
TO USE MINECART:  PUNCH TO MAKE MOVE THEN QUICKLY USE TO JUMP IN.  IT WILL TAKE A FEW TRIES TO GET RIGHT.  TO GRAB A CART:  CROUCH AND PUNCH.
MOST OF THE REALLY VALUABLE ORES CAN BE FOUND AT GREAT DEPTHS LIKE BELOW -4000, HOWEVER, THERE ARE RANDOM SIGHTINGS OF THESE ORES AT SHALLOWER DEPTHS.
USE RECYCLER TO GET MATERIALS FROM OLD TOOLS.  THIS IS YOUR NEW ANVIL.
THIS SERVER IS SUPPOSED TO BE CHALLENGING, IF IT IS TOO DIFFICULT FOR YOU THEN TRY TO TEAM UP WITH PEOPLE TO MAKE IT EASIER.
USE PUBLIC MINE ((THAT BUILDING STRAIGHT AHEAD WITH CACTUS))  TO GO MINING AT DEPTH.  BE WARNED::  MOBS ARE VERY TOUGH UNDERGROUND!!
BONES ARE GOLD AND GOLD IS MONEY.  COLLECT BONES AND DEPOSITE THEM IN VENDING MACHINE TO GET GOLD BAR.  USE GOLD BAR TO BUY ITEMS.  CRAFT 9 GOLD BAR INTO BLOCK TO BUY EXPENSIVE ITEMS.  OR MAKE GOLD ARMOR!
MONSTERS AND BAD NPC COME OUT AT NIGHT OR IN DARK AREAS, THEY ARE THE STRONGEST MOBS YOU WILL EVER FIGHT, SOME WITH 350HP SO IT IS WISE TO HAVE ARMOR AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  ARMOR IS SOLD IN THE SHOP TO YOUR RIGHT.
RIGHT CLICK FRIENDLY NPC TO HAVE THEM TEAM UP WITH YOU, THEY CAN FOLLOW, STAND, PROTECT YOU.  A GREAT PLAN IF EXPLORING DANGEROUS AREAS.
HOLD GOLD ORE IN HAND AND RIGHT-CLICK (USE) ON FRIENDLY NPC TO GET RANDOM GIFT LIKE FOOD OR TOOLS.
YOU CAN HUNT MONSTERS OR COLLECT BONES FOR MORE ITEMS LIKE BETTER TOOLS AND SWORDS.
